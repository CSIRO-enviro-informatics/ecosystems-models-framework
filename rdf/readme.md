`emf.ttl` is an [RDF](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-primer/) (graph) representation of the [Australian Ecosystems Models Framework](https://research.csiro.au/biodiversity-knowledge/projects/models-framework/) (EMF) ontology.
This contains a limited representations of the full set of members of the following classes: 
1. umbrella classes
2. archetype models
3. ecosystem expressions
4. NVIS major vegetation groups

It also contains a small subset of 
1. ecosystem transition drivers
2. ecosystem transition pathways

which support the description of the pathways for a single archetype state and transition model from the AEMF: **Archetype 3.3 "Obligate-seeder eucalypt woodlands"**. 

Drivers and pathways for the other archetype models are not included at this time, but are expected to be completed in due course.
